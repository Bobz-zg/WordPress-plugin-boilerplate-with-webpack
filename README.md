# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate
This is simplified fork of [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate).
Includes a Webpack build script and webpack-dev-server for local development.
Integrates PHP namespacing and PSR-4 autoloader for better experience.

Plugin is now moved to a new location [https://github.com/code-soup/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate](https://github.com/code-soup/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate)
